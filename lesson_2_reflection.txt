What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates empty git repository in the working directory to store all the commits. It can store all the changes that have been made in the file.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
Staging area act as a intermediate area between working directory and repository. Staging area contains modified version of the file which has not yet committed. add function helps
to put the updated version in the staging area. gitt diff command can differentiate versions between working directory and staging area. Finally, git commit command will
transfer file from staging area to repository.

What value do you think it offers?
It offers modified version of the file which has not yet committed, but needs to commit.
